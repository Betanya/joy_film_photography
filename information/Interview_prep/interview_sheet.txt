This technical interview is a one-hour discussion with a Senior Data Engineer and is designed to assess your practical, hands-on experience in building and managing modern, large-scale data platforms.

The focus is on how you apply core engineering principles to solve real-world data challenges

🎯 What We're Looking For
We want to understand your thought process and your ability to design robust solutions. Be prepared to discuss the trade-offs of your design choices (e.g., cost, complexity, latency).

The interview is divided into four main technical domains:

Domain

Core Focus

Assessment Goal

1. Cloud Data Architecture & Modeling

Designing data lakes/lakehouses, migration strategies, and choosing appropriate cloud services (Compute, Storage, Catalog).

Your ability to build scalable, reliable, and future-proof data platforms.

2. Data Processing & Performance Tuning

Working with distributed computing (e.g., Apache Spark), diagnosing slow pipelines, and optimizing performance.

Your practical knowledge of pipeline efficiency and troubleshooting skills.

3. Data Governance, Security, & Access

Securing sensitive data (PII), implementing access controls (RBAC/ABAC), and ensuring enterprise compliance.

Your understanding of security standards in a cloud environment.

4. Practical SQL & Analytical Querying

Writing complex SQL queries to solve business problems, often involving advanced functions.

Your proficiency in data manipulation and analytical logic.

🚀 How to Prepare Effectively
For each domain, review the core concepts and be ready to articulate your decision-making process.

Domain

Key Preparation Topics

Sample Practice Question

Architecture

Cloud Services: S3/ADLS, compute options, cataloging. Patterns: Data Lake vs. Lakehouse. Concepts: Batch/Streaming ingestion, data formats (Parquet, AVRO).

Practice: "Design an architecture for a new real-time fraud detection system that consumes event data from millions of users."

Performance

Spark: Shuffles, partitioning, caching, wide vs. narrow transformations. Troubleshooting: Identifying skew, small files, resource bottlenecks in the Spark UI.

Practice: "Your daily ETL job failed due to a cluster overload. Describe your systematic approach to troubleshooting the failure and preventing recurrence."

Security

PII Handling: Encryption, tokenization, hashing, masking. Access Control: IAM, RBAC/ABAC, table/column-level security in the cloud.

Practice: "How would you ensure only the HR team can see unmasked salary data, while other teams can only see aggregated metrics?"

SQL

Advanced Functions: Window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK()), CTEs, complex joins, and analytical aggregations (e.g., calculating percentages/ratios).

Practice: "Write a query to find the top 3 highest-spending customers for each region last month."
